(2017-11-07 19:51:25.406600) hdlax1: Yeah Monado would tell me he'd get home from work and there'd be like 50 runs
(2017-11-07 19:51:37.580630) hdlax1: Seems like this game is gonna need a lot of mods

(2017-11-07 20:06:18.117296) hdlax1: I think an Odyssey Any% tournament would be pretty cool to do in the future
(2017-11-07 20:07:44.922064) hdlax1: Not really any forfeits. Snap got arrested so he had to forfeit, and Jared was grinding BFBB. That's about it
(2017-11-07 20:08:13.517869) hdlax1: He had sex with minors
(2017-11-07 20:08:27.153495) hdlax1: His official trial is tomorrow actually. He could be going away for about 3 years
(2017-11-07 20:08:37.865814) hdlax1: That's like max sentence though
(2017-11-07 20:08:41.731029) hellabryan: what was the age difference?

(2017-11-07 20:09:06.361703) hdlax1: Colorado
(2017-11-07 20:09:25.367968) hellabryan: he'll probably get probation
(2017-11-07 20:09:33.267234) hellabryan: the girl's parents turn him in or something?
(2017-11-07 20:09:49.887759) hdlax1: Yeah, and his city is pretty chill. It's so small almost everyone knows eachother personally
(2017-11-07 20:10:16.078701) hdlax1: He turned himself in. He fled to Texas for a couple weeks. Ditched his phone and everything, and came back and turned himself in
(2017-11-07 20:10:49.574770) hellabryan: damn, that's probably the most evidence they have
(2017-11-07 20:11:28.445757) hdlax1: He got to await his trial at home, and he told me everything. Hopefully everything goes good for him tomorrow
(2017-11-07 20:11:54.615938) hellabryan: so it's going to a jury?
(2017-11-07 20:12:03.299119) hdlax1: Yep
(2017-11-07 20:12:36.919657) hellabryan: he's going to have a hard time pleading not guilty after fleeing the whole state
(2017-11-07 20:13:03.705511) hdlax1: It'll be interesting for sure. We'll see if he doesn't come back tomorrow
(2017-11-07 20:15:27.672110) hellabryan: so the plus 15 is just how much you lost last split? how can we tell how far ahead or behind pb you are?
(2017-11-07 20:20:20.797969) hdlax1: Sikk

(2017-11-18 23:57:44.879007) spikevegeta: So you have any thoughts on the route after 1.5 runs?
(2017-11-18 23:58:53.790279) spikevegeta: Yeah, I like to ask runners if any segments just feel slow
(2017-11-18 23:59:14.560954) spikevegeta: Sounds like the 1.2 route is at least fine
(2017-11-18 23:59:39.077063) spikevegeta: We can start work on re timing things for route 2.0
(2017-11-19 00:00:35.858398) epicallytossed: Spike I believe he's ahead of your pb right?
(2017-11-19 00:00:47.958697) spikevegeta: Probably, not sure
(2017-11-19 00:01:04.787081) spikevegeta: My power is out, so I can't check my splits

(2017-11-21 21:31:09.975970) captainmarcia: it's certainly improvable, he only knew half the route when he was doing that run
(2017-11-21 21:31:55.707643) captainmarcia: ouch :(
(2017-11-21 21:31:57.067047) bloob_shute: ye, the reason it's the wr is probs because he's the only runner
(2017-11-21 21:32:06.764858) captainmarcia: nah, he's not the only one
(2017-11-21 21:32:17.855425) captainmarcia: he's done a few runs of it actually, his first was 22 hours

(2017-11-21 21:33:26.968620) captainmarcia: there's a lot of room to improve past oki's run, I think he's said 9-10 hours should be possible for a good run, but it's certainly not easy

(2017-11-21 21:40:35.524375) bloob_shute: I think tho
(2017-11-21 21:40:36.879002) reddonuts: if you stand on the spot where it appears and go in to first person he spawns right on top of you
(2017-11-21 21:40:38.754331) bloob_shute: not sure
(2017-11-21 21:40:42.759421) bloob_shute: ye

(2017-11-21 22:03:16.317367) ubersloth26: 500 to get to darker, plus 3 from beating darker

(2017-11-23 21:39:01.285200) romaster2: SMO Any% now has the 2nd most runs submitted for any leaderboard at 1549 runs. Super Mario Bros. Any% has 1444 and Super Mario Sunshine Any% {Normal} has 2982.

(2017-11-23 21:50:11.390970) romaster2: Oh yeah, someone came up with a misc category that's not too memey: Max moons before post-game.
(2017-11-23 21:50:27.321370) romaster2: no idea what to call that
(2017-11-23 21:50:46.971818) tyan3: FVC I think, first visit clear
(2017-11-23 21:50:56.587280) bloob_shute: 100%< that's what you call it
(2017-11-23 21:51:05.398030) romaster2: Except it's not 100%
(2017-11-23 21:51:16.458568) romaster2: FVC isn't bad
(2017-11-23 21:51:19.990756) bloob_shute: ye but it's A version of 100%
(2017-11-23 21:51:40.740359) vidyakitty: 100%FVC
(2017-11-23 21:51:53.493429) vidyakitty: MAX% FVC?
(2017-11-23 21:52:02.986488) bloob_shute: MAXFVC
(2017-11-23 21:52:16.958797) romaster2: Would you return to any kingdom?
(2017-11-23 21:52:20.321472) zsocw: that sounds dirty
(2017-11-23 21:52:32.597360) romaster2: before being the last boswer that is
(2017-11-23 21:52:43.617104) tyan3: First Visit Clear implies that you get everything, so having max% or 100% is pointless
(2017-11-23 21:52:50.097418) zsocw: you can do that with 1 less goomba btw
(2017-11-23 21:53:13.859041) romaster2: Yeah the category title isn't going to be perfect but should be sufficient.
(2017-11-23 21:53:47.399040) romaster2: IMO All Missions should have been 100% and 100% should have been Max%
(2017-11-23 21:53:52.186140) romaster2: but I didn't care enough to even suggest it
(2017-11-23 21:53:55.424464) zsocw: 5 minutes ahead Kreygasm
(2017-11-23 21:54:14.953875) bloob_shute: beating wr by 5mins is insane
(2017-11-23 21:54:24.510034) phantaaminum: I've never seen a category called Max% instead of 100%
(2017-11-23 21:54:32.827478) zsocw: not really. very very unoptimized category
(2017-11-23 21:54:47.042711) bloob_shute: ye but still
(2017-11-23 21:54:49.305654) zsocw: 100 is still being dropped by hours at a time :p
(2017-11-23 21:54:50.257887) romaster2: Max% is often used to mean do_all_the_things
(2017-11-23 21:55:04.341827) vidyakitty: and 100% isn't yet fully routed
(2017-11-23 21:55:10.411350) vidyakitty: at least on the wr runs
(2017-11-23 21:55:14.853747) vidyakitty: okiW
(2017-11-23 21:55:16.581247) bloob_shute: ye, I plan to make a route that takes away 5 hrs @zsocw
(2017-11-23 21:55:26.491400) romaster2: Optimizing 100% is going to take quite a while
(2017-11-23 21:55:30.854092) bloob_shute: ye
(2017-11-23 21:55:32.411344) phantaaminum: Isnt 100% doing everything (collecting everything)?
(2017-11-23 21:55:38.872225) bloob_shute: but chrism said he'll run it
(2017-11-23 21:55:39.502346) romaster2: even if all the top players jumped on it it'd take a least 3 months before something really solid is set
(2017-11-23 21:55:39.799580) tyan3: only problem is that I think FVC would imply no revisits, but there are moons that require revisits (like taxi for example)
(2017-11-23 21:55:43.439023) vidyakitty: oki's quasi-route is still pretty quick
(2017-11-23 21:55:51.802168) zsocw: people say im nuts for saying 10 hours but i think it might be less
(2017-11-23 21:55:53.424991) romaster2: @tyan3 yeah that's what I thought
(2017-11-23 21:56:20.555290) bloob_shute: It can totally be done in 8 hrs or less
(2017-11-23 21:57:06.811975) bloob_shute: rip run
(2017-11-23 21:57:11.354727) bloob_shute: restart
(2017-11-23 21:57:13.324396) tyan3: so idk if there should be revisits or not \\xf0\\x9f\\xa4\\x94
(2017-11-23 21:57:15.467316) vidyakitty: minimum is darker side + 2.5 hours of coin grind + a couple more hours for longer moons optimized out
(2017-11-23 21:57:48.160640) bloob_shute: well, I've found the best coin farming place
(2017-11-23 21:57:56.356085) zsocw: do tell
(2017-11-23 21:58:02.116340) zsocw: is it a sekret
(2017-11-23 21:58:14.456927) bloob_shute: for the grind if you don't die, it's only 60~mins of grinding
(2017-11-23 21:58:18.213706) zsocw: U P H A T
(2017-11-23 21:58:27.763945) romaster2: @Odme What do you think of moving the assists/duplicate moon categories to a "Category Extensions"?
(2017-11-23 21:58:32.899120) bloob_shute: I said grinding twice
(2017-11-23 21:58:46.419040) romaster2: It's apparent not many people care for it

(2017-11-24 19:55:09.932757) thesludgygamer: When you capture the dinosaur, walk straight forward and fall off, then turn the camera and walk towards the trampoline without running, then as the right foot hits the ground, start dashing

(2017-11-24 19:59:46.642076) jayerictheepic01: Because the jump the cappy player does adds alot of speed.
(2017-11-24 20:00:07.476973) jayerictheepic01: And we could use that to our advantage.
(2017-11-24 20:01:43.552759) jayerictheepic01: Also, moon skip would be easier with those jumps too.

(2017-12-24 20:15:14.003173) masrock9: What do you get for winning the 602 race? Bragging rights? Also, what could make a 603 race? I would say take out SM64, add SMO any%, and remove Grandmaster Galaxy
(2017-12-24 20:15:15.494525) natetastic28: I think part of that is that he doubts that anyone will beat his wrs

(2017-12-24 20:17:50.029206) drayden15: the sooner you get done with the 602 the earlier you can go to sleep after playing ALL mario for a day

(2017-12-24 20:19:31.271630) masrock9: I have stuff to do so I\\\'ll be back in an hour or so. Cya everyone. (How come "An" is supposed to replace A when the next word starts with a vowel, like \\\'An apple\\\' yet we say \\\'An hour\\\' even though \\\'h\\\' is a consonant?)

(2017-12-30 02:56:23.253383) solar_gaming143: Yeah vallu, they should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given you the option like 100 coin stars in sm64
(2017-12-30 02:56:27.046346) spikevegeta: It just personally makes the 602 REALLY hard to finish
(2017-12-30 02:56:31.840941) drayden15: vallu, what they should do with greens is let you stay until you have all green stars in the galaxy. If stars are in different levels, it would automatically take you to the next level
(2017-12-30 02:56:35.334224) vallu111: yeah in 3dw you can finish every level's collectables in one visit
(2017-12-30 02:56:58.926616) vallu111: although they still want to play through each level with every character triThink

(2017-12-30 02:57:07.736714) mariodude34500: @RedDonuts at a WR player pace it would currently take 37-38 hours
(2017-12-30 02:57:09.307327) rmac: need to play every level twice for 100% LUL
(2017-12-30 02:57:18.889296) secondarysuppress: Which is why 3dw isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a true 3D Mario game kek
(2017-12-30 02:57:22.107098) jcboorgo: (the black ghost guy)

(2017-12-30 02:57:56.810923) spikevegeta: I wake back up HARD
(2017-12-30 02:58:08.418734) vallu111: Man I was really wishing odyssey would have the hardest and sickest final challenge level
(2017-12-30 02:58:20.153805) rmac: darker side is ezpz
(2017-12-30 02:58:25.159020) jcboorgo: Darker Side is nice but like not hard enough
(2017-12-30 02:58:28.196129) spikevegeta: yeah, that's the thing with SMO
(2017-12-30 02:58:33.114479) spikevegeta: Beautiful, fun game
(2017-12-30 02:58:36.759140) themightyspork: Man chrism v vallu perfect run is still 1 of the hypest thing ive ever watched
(2017-12-30 02:58:39.234274) spikevegeta: but it NEVER tries to challenge the player
(2017-12-30 02:58:41.022238) vallu111: you can skip the entire darker side and even if you do it, you can skip most of it inside of it too
(2017-12-30 02:58:46.783916) reddonuts: perfect run is harder than darker side
(2017-12-30 02:58:55.095044) reddonuts: no question
(2017-12-30 02:58:55.767746) drayden15: vallu what do you think is the hardest moon in odyssey?
(2017-12-30 02:58:58.055363) rmac: @RedDonuts by a mile
(2017-12-30 02:59:30.313368) jl456lj: @drayden15 the last moon from Toadette Kappa
(2017-12-30 02:59:31.853632) vallu111: Odyssey's main goal is to just make the player have as much fun as possible, and giving the player a challenge could ruin that
(2017-12-30 02:59:41.351255) ordinaryperson98: I'm going to attempt Darker Side myself within a few days given I complete eveything else in SMO.
(2017-12-30 02:59:56.812003) rmac: that one bullet bill secret level was difficult
(2017-12-30 03:00:01.604213) vallu111: and it kinda works because you can make the game challenging by running it

(2017-12-30 03:00:10.659706) reddonuts: odyssey was more about exploration and finding hidden stuff
(2017-12-30 03:00:27.319939) reddonuts: rather than straight up platforming
(2017-12-30 03:00:33.214101) vallu111: oh yeah, the hint arts were kinda challenging OpieOP

(2017-12-30 03:01:25.356671) ordinaryperson98: The only thing that does screw Odyssey up is the Jump rope and Volleyball moons being difficult as hell
(2017-12-30 03:01:31.734244) secondarysuppress: Hey @vallu111 is smashing my face into my controller a good method for doing the roll clip?
(2017-12-30 03:01:37.546883) jcboorgo: @solar_gaming143 get Odyseey and only with that your Switch is worth it
(2017-12-30 03:01:39.658902) vallu111: maybe, maybe not stratus, would have to kill my sleep schedule for that

(2018-01-09 20:26:21.615686) firstruns: Well uh sorry for being a dick. I'll try to be more constructive. Good luck on the sub-2 mission. You might be able to tie 2nd.
(2018-01-09 20:26:30.363630) firstruns: or even wr
(2018-01-09 20:26:35.351261) firstruns: get* not tie
(2018-01-09 20:26:52.189758) noguy5: Wait you still do the jump out strat? Wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that proven inconsistent
(2018-01-09 20:28:56.972583) noguy5: Huh, really? Are you hitting the wall in the right spot?
(2018-01-09 20:34:18.081878) solar_gaming143: I was watching vallu do cheese skip, it seems pretty hard to get consistently
(2018-01-09 20:40:45.524958) solar_gaming143: Nice glod PogChamp
(2018-01-09 20:41:47.124076) firstruns: Do you ever plan to run All Missions again?
(2018-01-09 20:43:18.284084) solar_gaming143: Would you ever/have you ever ran 100% of this game?
(2018-01-09 20:43:40.064586) firstruns: 100% is kind of a less fun, longer run of All Missions imo
(2018-01-09 20:44:07.145603) solar_gaming143: Yeah basically, getting loads of coins would be a pain
(2018-01-09 20:44:22.235634) firstruns: Yeah. I believe there is 45 minutes of coin farming in the run.
(2018-01-09 20:44:27.730813) odmewhirter: !title Odyssey Any% for 1:08

(2018-01-09 20:44:44.381360) firstruns: Are you going for the Tech Bop
(2018-01-09 20:44:54.901755) solar_gaming143: Any% yay
(2018-01-09 20:45:35.810630) solar_gaming143: Any% is more fun though imo
(2018-01-09 20:45:59.473583) firstruns: Debatably. I personally find World Peace to be the most fun run.
(2018-01-09 20:46:12.023891) firstruns: with Darker side being a close second
(2018-01-09 20:46:20.259032) firstruns: lol
(2018-01-09 20:46:23.849549) firstruns: Me too
(2018-01-09 20:46:46.747368) solar_gaming143: I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have a valid opinion, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a switch nor have I ever played odyssey
(2018-01-09 20:47:16.445732) firstruns: What do you mean?
(2018-01-09 20:47:22.896294) firstruns: oh, yeah
(2018-01-09 20:47:25.848328) firstruns: I guess you're right
(2018-01-09 20:47:44.311557) solar_gaming143: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting it soon though, then I can try it myself
(2018-01-09 20:48:51.198542) solar_gaming143: Odme you need the new movement strats to get a sub 6 cascade Kappa
(2018-01-09 20:49:55.655902) solar_gaming143: Oops, sorry
