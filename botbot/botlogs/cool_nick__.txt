(2018-02-18 20:27:49.522531) kulbromove: and the coruption ball is up high and can only be achieved by jumping on a pineapple to go infinitely up

(2018-03-04 00:43:06.498865) pokepowerz4life: Do you remember that weird block with the moon on it?
(2018-03-04 00:43:40.294536) pokepowerz4life: You have to push it somewhere I think
(2018-03-04 00:43:45.025011) piecity_: o shit my route might be good
(2018-03-04 00:44:39.558564) piecity_: fuck
(2018-03-04 00:44:49.484231) piecity_: so i got it but it sucks ass
(2018-03-04 00:45:12.907085) pokepowerz4life: Are you sure you played the right song in front of the Triforce?
(2018-03-04 00:45:39.012698) pokepowerz4life: Try Z targeting it before you play the song
(2018-03-04 00:45:47.658496) piecity_: well i guess i should try Cascade
(2018-03-04 00:46:13.723605) pokepowerz4life: No, that one brings it down to the bottom
(2018-03-04 00:46:24.051391) pokepowerz4life: It's supposed to at least
(2018-03-04 00:48:27.692824) pokepowerz4life: Zelda's Lullaby
(2018-03-04 00:48:44.807587) pokepowerz4life: Just stand right in front of it
(2018-03-04 00:48:48.972610) pokepowerz4life: And play the song
(2018-03-04 00:49:02.895337) pokepowerz4life: Yeeee
(2018-03-04 00:50:18.830902) pokepowerz4life: Use your hookshot on the clams
(2018-03-04 00:51:31.242707) pokepowerz4life: It doesn't matter which door you open, you'll get another key
(2018-03-04 00:52:36.954920) pokepowerz4life: Do you have a heal, or is your fairy the only thing you've got?
(2018-03-04 00:53:12.652737) pokepowerz4life: Oh, lol
(2018-03-04 00:53:26.804571) pokepowerz4life: You should be able to get 3 bottles by this point

(2018-03-04 00:55:28.926977) pokepowerz4life: I'm willing to bet you've walked off many edges in this game
(2018-03-04 00:55:32.309415) pokepowerz4life: Also, nice death
(2018-03-04 00:57:17.214913) pokepowerz4life: Taking your sword out to do a jump attack doesn't reduce the damage of your fall. in fact, I think in the N64 version it can increase it, because of the little boost doing that attack gives you
(2018-03-04 01:01:37.441574) pokepowerz4life: I wish I had my 3DS on me so I could finish that Master Quest FeelsBadMan
(2018-03-04 01:01:46.062088) pokepowerz4life: You need the longshot for that golden boi
(2018-03-04 01:03:15.094079) pokepowerz4life: There isn't a mini boss in this Temple
(2018-03-04 01:03:27.609931) pokepowerz4life: At least I don't think
(2018-03-04 01:04:12.845325) pokepowerz4life: Shadow Link isn't in the Water Temple
(2018-03-04 01:04:14.790802) pokepowerz4life: Is he?
(2018-03-04 01:04:21.498843) pokepowerz4life: Look on the map
(2018-03-04 01:05:44.618619) pokepowerz4life: Oh, he is in the Water Temple
(2018-03-04 01:06:03.706820) pokepowerz4life: Ads NotLikeThis

(2018-03-04 01:09:39.500383) pokepowerz4life: 20 years, please, if you get 100 its every night it only takes 10 days
(2018-03-04 01:09:59.151005) pokepowerz4life: Even then, you could get 1k bits in one night, so it's just up to luck
(2018-03-04 01:11:17.625333) pokepowerz4life: You get 5-100 bits, 100 being the least common, so if you're lucky enough to get 10 100 bit ads in a row, you can get 1k+ bits
(2018-03-04 01:11:54.238666) pokepowerz4life: You need the long shot to get over that side
(2018-03-04 01:12:27.689906) pokepowerz4life: You need the long shot to get over there also

(2018-03-04 01:16:08.503348) piecity_: The dragon boi is no more
(2018-03-04 01:16:11.646614) pokepowerz4life: Oh, I don't have a Switch, I had no idea what you were talking about OpieOP
(2018-03-04 01:16:34.053950) pokepowerz4life: Yeah, it goes low, middle, high, low
(2018-03-04 01:16:39.195071) piecity_: ofc im talking about Odyseey
(2018-03-04 01:17:02.945033) pokepowerz4life: I know what you're talking about now, it just didn't cross my mind

(2018-03-04 01:23:03.520160) pokepowerz4life: I think there's a room in the middle floor you need to go to
(2018-03-04 01:23:10.069791) pokepowerz4life: With the key
(2018-03-04 01:25:46.951940) pokepowerz4life: Dude

(2018-03-04 01:26:04.061930) pokepowerz4life: With the other torch
(2018-03-04 01:26:58.452237) pokepowerz4life: Oh
(2018-03-04 01:26:59.669279) pokepowerz4life: Hmmm
(2018-03-04 01:27:59.255237) pokepowerz4life: You need the water to be at the bottom to go in that room
(2018-03-04 01:30:39.632719) pokepowerz4life: I forgot that I have an adblocker Keepo
(2018-03-04 01:31:38.216229) pokepowerz4life: Every time I reset player an ad pops up, so I just enabled the blocker
(2018-03-04 01:31:47.278916) pokepowerz4life: It works perfectly fine for me
(2018-03-04 01:32:53.810658) pokepowerz4life: The only thing I can think of is somewhere on the top floor

(2018-03-04 01:38:03.818740) pokepowerz4life: Now that I do remember, it seems so obvious what to do
(2018-03-04 01:38:55.628626) pokepowerz4life: Hey, it's easier to figure out what to do when you're actually playing the game
(2018-03-04 01:39:50.157606) coldeggman: im surprised you're doing the water temple

(2018-12-24 17:04:31.223877) frikkinfriks14: Mole cricket makes a consistent lower sound. It's hard to describe.
(2018-12-24 17:04:42.002439) frikkinfriks14: It's basically that, yeah.
(2018-12-24 17:05:21.152642) frikkinfriks14: You're in New Years so there's so much fucking constant annoying music it's nearly impossible to hear other stuff.
(2018-12-24 17:06:08.292765) frikkinfriks14: I'm exaggerating, it's not that quiet but you can miss it if your TV's speakers don't pick up its type of sound very well.
(2018-12-24 17:06:35.265396) frikkinfriks14: For finding one, really just anywhere with ground, no water and not too much in the way is good for searching for it.
(2018-12-24 17:12:32.093284) frikkinfriks14: Checking your mailbox would help
(2018-12-24 17:13:46.910975) frikkinfriks14: If you're further from it it gets quieter.
(2018-12-24 17:17:08.886059) frikkinfriks14: Probably.

(2018-12-24 17:19:58.626841) frikkinfriks14: It was near Tank's house. Like one acre back I think.
(2018-12-24 17:20:12.804449) frikkinfriks14: No it was the mole cricket, I know what it sounds like.
(2018-12-24 17:20:44.923079) frikkinfriks14: It's probably quieter. You should hear a consistent croak. It despawned because you moved so far away.
(2018-12-24 17:21:37.227867) frikkinfriks14: This is one of the reasons why I don't like doing net.

(2019-02-17 17:09:28.411359) undercoverorange: y cam turn
(2019-02-17 17:10:53.447053) undercoverorange: buffer spin is when you spin the stick before landing then jumping again
(2019-02-17 17:11:18.889821) undercoverorange: yes
(2019-02-17 17:11:52.578083) undercoverorange: that was a buffer spin. the thing you were trying to do to get on top of the shine gate is called a buffer spin
(2019-02-17 17:12:01.392251) undercoverorange: i would look that one up its hard to explain
(2019-02-17 17:12:18.871792) undercoverorange: not a buffer spin. a momentum spin sorryu
(2019-02-17 17:13:03.485598) undercoverorange: you need to y turn after the buffer spin to slid on the wall of the shine gate
(2019-02-17 17:13:49.301500) undercoverorange: Youll need a bit of momentum
(2019-02-17 17:13:56.334964) undercoverorange: so run then do a buffer spin
(2019-02-17 17:14:13.351726) undercoverorange: yes
(2019-02-17 17:14:56.268103) undercoverorange: press y when you hit the wall then press a
(2019-02-17 17:16:58.842783) undercoverorange: you are doing your spin input too fast on your momentum spin
(2019-02-17 17:18:31.831701) undercoverorange: a perfect momentum spin is when you dont see him spin before he does the actual spin jump
(2019-02-17 17:19:08.729001) undercoverorange: they do
(2019-02-17 17:19:27.713210) undercoverorange: if theres 1 or 2 frames of spin its ok

(2019-03-07 00:21:26.466997) coldeggman: 1 is in the same room as the one where you swim to it and the other is the one before the boss key room
(2019-03-07 00:21:55.027109) coldeggman: this one is in a beehive on the right
(2019-03-07 00:22:04.800239) coldeggman: on the ceiling

(2019-03-07 00:39:21.103606) coldeggman: no you'll have to beat the boss again
(2019-03-07 00:39:48.033256) coldeggman: but you can beat the boss instantly at the start of the dungeon when you reset time
(2019-03-07 00:40:25.146650) coldeggman: yes but you were supposed to get the deku princess
(2019-03-07 00:41:26.478296) coldeggman: the deku princess was at the area where you beat the temple
(2019-03-07 00:41:34.284315) coldeggman: where you had that convo with the fairy
(2019-03-07 00:42:11.552071) coldeggman: you had to slash the wall of grass with your sword

(2019-03-31 23:20:04.422033) golderzoa: and new leaf is almost the exact same as city folk
(2019-03-31 23:20:17.686284) golderzoa: except you go a different part of september
(2019-03-31 23:20:37.551348) golderzoa: i told you new leaf isn't bad
(2019-03-31 23:21:10.707955) golderzoa: you only need to pay the first loan after you pay off the tent
(2019-03-31 23:21:19.527853) golderzoa: so basicly two debts
(2019-03-31 23:21:29.220755) golderzoa: the market thing was bs
(2019-03-31 23:22:00.129015) golderzoa: it allows tortimer to show up
(2019-03-31 23:22:04.148898) golderzoa: and you travel one more day
(2019-03-31 23:22:16.334793) golderzoa: then kappn shows up
(2019-03-31 23:22:38.850063) golderzoa: and you pay 1k bells a trip to the island
(2019-03-31 23:22:51.234423) golderzoa: sadly i like this run better then e+

(2019-03-31 23:24:28.492909) golderzoa: i thought about doing a Single Segement all debts for memes
(2019-03-31 23:24:34.266686) golderzoa: for this game
(2019-03-31 23:25:26.599816) golderzoa: of course the runs would be glitchless
(2019-03-31 23:25:37.462967) golderzoa: that means it'd take 5 days
(2019-03-31 23:25:46.105585) golderzoa: because they're 5 debts
(2019-03-31 23:26:15.255679) golderzoa: since you don't save and quit and reload file
(2019-03-31 23:26:24.359317) golderzoa: you keep the console on the entire time
(2019-03-31 23:26:56.495256) golderzoa: you use it only in the city
(2019-03-31 23:27:07.580424) golderzoa: other then that it's pretty much worthless
(2019-03-31 23:27:59.856846) golderzoa: ac switch is pretty much the same thing for golden rod
(2019-03-31 23:28:32.605619) golderzoa: i'd assume net is gonna be way too much fun to route on that game
(2019-03-31 23:29:25.657457) golderzoa: i put a route for golden axe on SRC
(2019-03-31 23:29:56.465564) golderzoa: good night

(2019-10-02 23:41:40.192710) golderzoa: well at least i made the rod route for this game better by better at least you\\\'ll get to june "most of the time" w/o resetting
(2019-10-02 23:41:51.938163) golderzoa: it's better then september route back then
(2019-10-02 23:42:19.398361) golderzoa: using move on strategy
(2019-10-02 23:42:41.003101) golderzoa: don't do this in gamecube animal crossing this sucks there
(2019-10-02 23:44:30.557037) golderzoa: i mean for this game i made the route to be
(2019-10-02 23:45:14.305944) golderzoa: more consistent and less forced to stay on one month and forced to stay in one month
(2019-10-02 23:45:31.187049) golderzoa: as this game has Zero Peak time
(2019-10-02 23:45:49.208780) golderzoa: in game cube this is bad because of peak times
(2019-10-02 23:46:05.971409) golderzoa: this game has a different system in which RNG spawns fish
(2019-10-02 23:46:43.520233) golderzoa: so gamecube strats will never work and YOU WILL NOT ever finish a run using them
(2019-10-02 23:47:42.358823) golderzoa: i can see golden rod for this game going down to sub 3 hours at least
(2019-10-02 23:48:02.742606) golderzoa: accounting for a bit over average luck
(2019-10-02 23:49:38.010293) golderzoa: like for this game depending on what very large fish you get in the river area in september segement you change what month you use in winter segement either december or january depending on what you caught
(2019-10-02 23:50:38.488724) golderzoa: like you get pike you just do january instead of decemeber
(2019-10-02 23:51:07.609724) golderzoa: if you get dorado you do decemeber instead and get pike later
(2019-10-02 23:51:45.114232) golderzoa: the japanese guys have gotten golden axe down to 41 mins
(2019-10-02 23:52:31.787122) golderzoa: gotta give them credit they destroyed us
(2019-10-02 23:52:47.172896) golderzoa: they didn't just beat my time the murdered the category

(2019-10-02 23:53:40.022300) golderzoa: they made it way better
(2019-10-02 23:54:13.161920) golderzoa: they have a completely different route that they made for this way of interest
(2019-10-02 23:54:21.026149) golderzoa: they do 5 tickets
(2019-10-02 23:55:02.635365) golderzoa: we used to do six they cut it down to 5 tickets and just hope they good drops

(2019-10-03 00:22:49.576147) golderzoa: believe it or not the remake on english has a lot of touch menu quit glitches
(2019-10-03 00:24:56.902281) golderzoa: you can warp to any ending in the game w/o doing much of anything there's a no IQ which means you cannot touch the inventory on touch screen and quit out of the game at any point
(2019-10-03 00:26:47.952281) golderzoa: um having the touch screen screen invontory active and quitting the game makes weird things happen
(2019-10-03 00:26:59.418251) golderzoa: let's say this is worst programing then dk64
(2019-10-03 00:27:10.142022) golderzoa: that's all you need to know

(2019-10-03 00:29:42.173525) golderzoa: since most of the game you only have 3 health and most everything kills you
(2019-10-03 00:30:07.452055) drywalleater: damn sounds hard but i mean it is hard mode

(2019-10-03 00:31:49.314705) drywalleater: thats sick it would be sweet if someone made that for steam sa2 but that can be tased on gc so i doubt it would ever be made
